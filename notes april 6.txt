A normal HTTP request is triggered by clicking on a hyperlink or submitting a form, after which the browser may appear non
responsive while the browser waits for the server response. A page remains non-responsive until the request is sent to and processed
by the server, and a response is returned to the browser. This delay may be undesirable for some web applications and may annoy
users if the delay is long.
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique to asynchronously communicate with a server and update a web page once
the response is received, Without reloading the whole web page. An asynchronous request occurs when the web application sends a
request to the server and continues running without waiting for the server response, Although the X'in Ajax stands for XML. Ajax is
used to transmit plain. text HTML, XML and JSON
XMLHttpRequest is an object for communicating with web servers using Ajax. Using the XMLHUpRequest object allows web
browsers to hide the communication latency and continue to provide a responsive user interface while waiting for a server response
The XMLHItpRequest object defines handlers for events that occur during the request/response cycle. Ex.

‹script›
//let movieinfo = document. getElementById ("movieinfo") ;
let hr = new XMLHttpRequest();
×hr. addEventListener ("load",
function){
document.body. innerHTML
xhr.response;
});
xhr.open ("GET",
"https://edqaa.com/t/Echo?x=1&y=3");
×hr.send() ;
</script>
