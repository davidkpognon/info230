Javascript: syntax of java
Has no compilation, only interpretation by js engine in web browser. 

Only language running on web front

syntax between python and java strong type checking
for js:
<script>... </script>
Variable var x = 1;
x is the visible globally
let y = 2 accessible locally

Javascript can be embedded ina htlm doc
or stand only that linked to htlm documents similarto css

fucntion (x,y)
{
    return x+ y:
}
var fname = function(x,y)
fucntion (x,y)
{
    return 2*x+ y:
}
x==y really means x and y reflects to the same memory location
parsegloat("abc") is Nan
x ==y  <==> at some moments the values happen to be the same
